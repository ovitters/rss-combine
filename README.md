# rss-combine
Combines RSS entries taken from multiple RSS files

## Purpose

I needed something where I could make an offline copy of an RSS feed and
combine (merge) the various entries. There didn't seem to be an existing tool
which could do this. Further, I wanted the tool to be quick.

I wrote it in Rust to become better at Rust.
